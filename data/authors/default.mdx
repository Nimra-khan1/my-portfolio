I am Nimra Khan, a passionate frontend developer with a strong foundation in HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, and React.js. I love creating interactive, responsive, and visually appealing websites. My focus is on crafting seamless user experiences while ensuring code quality and performance optimization.

Currently, I am pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering at Lahore College for Women University (LCWU), where I am building a strong foundation in software development. I am working on expanding my skills in modern web technologies, particularly in frontend development, and staying updated with the latest trends in web development.
